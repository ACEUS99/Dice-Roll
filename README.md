This project was created through the Scrimba frontend developer path course at www.scrimba.com.

The languages used throughout this project were HTML, CSS and Javascript.

This project initially looked quite difficult as this was one of the earlier projects given as a challenge on the Scrimba platform. But I have listed it on here because I was able to successfully reach the correct solutions to all tasks for the build.
